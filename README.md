# RSI-Indicator

The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is a widely-used momentum oscillator in technical analysis that helps traders evaluate the strength and speed of price movements for various assets, such as stocks, commodities, and currencies. Developed by J. Welles Wilder in 1978, the RSI ranges from 0 to 100 and is typically calculated over a 14-day period.

The RSI operates on the principle that prices tend to close higher in an uptrend and lower in a downtrend. It is used to identify overbought or oversold conditions in a market, signaling potential reversal points. An RSI reading above 70 is generally considered to indicate that the asset is overbought, suggesting that a price correction or pullback might be imminent. Conversely, an RSI reading below 30 is seen as an indication that the asset is oversold, implying that it may be undervalued and poised for a rebound.

In addition to identifying overbought and oversold conditions, the RSI can also be used to spot divergence, convergence, and failure swings, providing traders with further insights into potential market reversals and trends. By integrating the RSI with other technical analysis tools and indicators, traders can enhance their decision-making processes and improve their trading strategies
